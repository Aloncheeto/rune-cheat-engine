Today, i decided to show the public something, well there has been a executor going around called "Netflix" which is just cheat engine source, with the icons changed and the name changed. Using our dev Jayys script he posted on verm. So this dude decided to scam people with this thing executor called "Netflix" using jays stuff and charges people 25$.

### How to you use CE with roblox?

- Launch roblox APP for atleast 10 seconds, get into a game
- Go to this link from WEAREDEVS https://wearedevs.net/d/NOPDE%20Engine
- Extract, the downloaded file to desktop, run CE then select Windows10Unverisal.exe
- BOOM there you go CE working on roblox and you don't have to get scammed by a loser with no money

### Executor
- Follow the instructions here -> https://robloxscripts.com/cheat-engine-script-execution-for-byfron-on-roblox-uwp/
- you can get the script to run from this github repo, under exec.lua

### Web Version
- To get it working on the web version it will take leet haxor skill JK just download the CE source
- Rename the files anything to do with CE and change the file icon
- change when they set the values 0000000000000000 and 00007fffffffffff and just set it to something random, then when setGbScanOptionsEnabled is called with true set them back to those original values

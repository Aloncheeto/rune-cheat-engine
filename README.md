Today, i decided to show the public something, well there has been a executor going around called "Netflix" which is just cheat engine source, with the icons changed and the name changed. Using our dev Jayys script he posted on verm. So this dude decided to scam people with this thing executor called "Netflix" using jays stuff and charges people 25$.

### How to you use CE with roblox?
well it's quite simple and you don't have to pay 25$ for it either :skull: this will only work for the UWP version for roblox

- Install the UWP version of roblox from Microsoft web store
- Launch roblox APP for atleast 10 seconds, get into a game
- Go to this link from WEAREDEVS https://wearedevs.net/d/NOPDE%20Engine
- Extract, the downloaded file to desktop, run CE then select Windows10Unverisal.exe
- BOOM there you go CE working on roblox and you don't have to get scammed by a loser with no money
